Hi There,

I am currently a member of technical staff software engineer at <a href='https://amd.com/'>AMD</a> in the <a href='https://github.com/ROCm/rccl'>RCCL</a> team, I am passionate about all things HPC. Before my current role I was HPC engineer at Shearwater Geoservices, where I managed, provisioned and supported multiple petaflop HPC clusters around the globe for seismic data processing. My expertise is mainly in HPC infra, but I do tinker around with RDMA and GPU programming from time to time. I am currently exploring large scale CI/CD deployment for HPC clusters, and working a suite of end-to-end workflows for anaylyzing and documenting performance regression.
